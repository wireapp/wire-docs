# Welcome to Wire’s documentation!

If you are a Wire end-user, please check out our [support pages](https://support.wire.com/).

The targeted audience of this documentation is:

- the curious power-user (people who want to understand how the server components of Wire work)
- on-premise operators/administrators (people who want to self-host Wire-Server on their own datacentres or cloud)
- developers (people who are working with the wire-server source code)

If you are a developer, you may want to check out the “Notes for developers” first.

Release notes of `wire-server` can be found [here](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/releases).
