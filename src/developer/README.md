# Notes for developers

If you are an on-premise operator (administrating your own self-hosted installation of wire-server), you may want to go back to [docs.wire.com](https://docs.wire.com/) and ignore this section of the docs.

If you are a wire end-user, please check out our [support pages](https://support.wire.com/).

What you need to know as a user of the Wire backend: concepts, features,
and API. We want to keep these up to date. They could benefit from some
re-ordering, and they are far from complete, but we hope they will still
help you.
