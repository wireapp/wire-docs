#### NOTE
If you use ssh *keys*, and the user you login with is either root or can elevate to root without a password, you don’t need to do anything further to use ansible. If, however, you use password authentication for ssh access, and/or your login user needs a password to become root, see [Manage ansible authentication settings](../ansible-authentication.md#ansible-authentication).
