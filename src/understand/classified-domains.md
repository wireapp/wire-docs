# Classified Domains

<a id="id1"></a>

As a backend administrator, if you want to control which other backends (identified by their domain) are “classified”,

change the following `galley` configuration in the `value.yaml.gotmpl` file of the wire-server chart:

```yaml
galley:
  replicaCount: 1
  config:
  ...
    featureFlags:
    ...
      classifiedDomains:
        status: enabled
        config:
          domains: ["domain-that-is-classified.link", "some-other-classified-domain.link"]
          ...
```

#### NOTE
Note that when enabling this feature, it is important to provide your own domain too in the list of domains.

In the example above, “domain-that-is-classified.link” and “some-other-classified-domain.link” are your domains.

This is not only a `backend` configuration, but also a `team` configuration/feature.

This means that different combinations of configurations will have different results.

Here is a table to navigate the possible configurations:

| Backend Config enabled/disabled   | Backend Config Domains                     | Team Config enabled/disabled   | Team Config Domains   | User’s view                    |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Enabled                           | [domain1.example.com]                      | Not configured                 | Not configured        | Enabled, [domain1.example.com] |
| Enabled                           | [domain1.example.com][domain1.example.com] | Enabled                        | Not configured        | Enabled, [domain1.example.com] |
| Enabled                           | [domain1.example.com]                      | Enabled                        | [domain2.example.com] | Enabled, Undefined             |
| Enabled                           | [domain1.example.com]                      | Disabled                       | Anything              | Undefined                      |
| Disabled                          | Anything                                   | Not configured                 | Not configured        | Disabled, no domains           |
| Disabled                          | Anything                                   | Enabled                        | [domain2.example.com] | Undefined                      |

The table assumes the following:

- When backend level config says that this feature is enabled, it is illegal to not specify domains at the backend level.
- When backend level config says that this feature is disabled, the list of domains is ignored.
- When team level feature is disabled, the accompanying domains are ignored.

To disable, either omit the entry entirely (it is disabled by default), or provide the following:

```yaml
  classifiedDomains:
    status: disabled
    config:
      domains: []
```
